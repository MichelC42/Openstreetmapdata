Openstreetmap data issues in PlannerStack served areas

## Why

To treat osm data issues/problems and/or ideas to correct as github issues and be able to set bounties on them.

## How

Create a [note](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes) on Openstreetmap and include the [url](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#Map_Notes_API) in an issue and assign a tag that you think best describes it. We'll try to correct, set a bounty or orgainize a mapping party to get it done. To speed up the process feel free to [set your own bounties](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/plannerstack)!
